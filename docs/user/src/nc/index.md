# In brief: sample manager


Sample managers, also known as national coordinators (abreviated as NC) accounts are created by study coordinators. They are responsible for keeping sample data accurate, and monitor fieldwork. Sample managers users may only perform actions and view data within the samples they have been assigned. Given those restrictions, they may perform the following tasks:

## Sample operations

- [importing panelist contact data](importing-a-sample.md) for their national sample as a comma separated value file (.csv), following the [sample file specification for import](sample-import-export-fields.md)
- viewing and updating panelist data records either one by one or in bulk. In the latter case, the file must have the same format specified for import, where columns and rows may be omitted. As an example, a cell left blank sets the value to a blank
- [exporting national sample data](sample-import-export-fields.md#export-fields) as comma separated value file (.csv) (for postal mail merging)
- [panelist deactivation](panelist-deactivation.md)

## More sample operations

- [panelist portal help text](panel-level-variables.md): for each managed sample, the sample manager can provide customised help text to be displayed in the panelist portal.

## Fieldwork monitoring

- [monitoring surveys](survey-monitoring.md): the study coordinator first creates individual survey links for all panelists that will be included in a survey wave. Panelists can be invited to a survey through messages deliveries by email or Short Text Messages (SMS)
- [monitoring email and SMS deliveries](message-delivery-monitoring.md) once the study coordinator has invited panelist to anwser a survey using [message deliveries](../hq/fieldwork.md#inviting-panelists-to-answer-a-survey), each sample manager is able to monitor the effective distribution of messages and track bounced messages
