In this use case, the system will be used to invite one sample only, to answer a questionnaire. Contents items, i.e. questionnaire and messages will only be translated into languages that are used by this sample.

The scenario could be drafted as below:

The national coordinator:

- Creates a questionnaire on the survey platform. The questionnaire should be translated into english and sent to ESS-ERIC and REB 
- Shares the questionnaires with a Qualtrics operational account.
- Creates messages on the survey platform in corresponding language(s),
- Put messages in the dedicated shared Messages Library, to be used for invitations and reminders.

Head-quarters :

- Finally, a study coordinator triggers country-specific invitations for country-specific questionnaires simultaneously.
