# In brief: translation editor
The WPSS information system can accomodate as many languages as needed.
A language value is set at the respondent level, it is a mandatory value <!-- (../nc/sample-import-export-fields.md/#lng) -->. This allows for example to accomodate samples with several languages, or the same language to be used for several samples.

Apart from questionnaires and messages (emails and short text messages) that are to be tranlated, WPSS access for respondents, or WPSS panelist portal, has to be translated once.
