# User roles

The rationale is as follows:
**actions** are triggered from WPSS, and **content** is managed from the survey platform.

Access to (personal) data is granted on a **need-to-know basis**, for each role, as shown in the table below:


role    |   WPSS access    |   Survey platform access    |   Access to personal data
:-------|:-----------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
[`Survey coordinator`](../hq/index.md) | ✔ | |
[`Sample manager`](../nc/index.md) | ✔ | | restricted to assigned sample data
[`Survey manager`](../survey/index.md) | | ✔ |
[`Message editor`](../m/index.md) | | ✔ |
[`Translation editor`](../tr/index.md) | | ✔ |
[`Survey Data archive`](../d/index.md) | | ✔ | pseudonymized survey data
[**`Panelist`**](../p/index.md) | optional (panelist portal) | via individual survey link | personal contact details (on panelist portal)
