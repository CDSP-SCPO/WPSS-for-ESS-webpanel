# In brief




WPSS stands for **W**eb **P**anel **S**ample **S**ervice.

It is based on a web application paired with the Qualtrics survey platform to meet the specific needs of cross-national web surveys.

WPSS enables:

- a **centralised management of survey fielding orchestration** (publishing, sending invites and reminders),

- and **decentralised and privacy-compliant handling of panelist data**.

When designing the software, our key points were:

- to look for scalability,
- to provide GDPR compliant personal data management features,
- to control the technical stack (django, Python, Celery),
- to look for easy deployment (docker containers),
- and more generally to keep sustainability in mind.
