# In brief: study coordinator

Study coordinators are part of the central study team (often referred to as “headquarters” and abreviated as HQ), and are responsible for a range of survey and sample management tasks detailed.
Study coordinators are not able to access panel members’ contact details.
As part of the initial setup of the application, a set of study coordinator user accounts are created by the development team. From then on, study coordinator is autonomous to take control of the application by performing the following tasks:

## [Seeding a study](seeding-a-study.md)

- creating sample manager accounts,
- creating national samples,
- assigning national coordinators to samples,

## [Managing questionnaire](questionnaire.md), [messages](../m) and their [translations](../tr/)

- viewing the list of all surveys available on the survey platform, including hints on translation progress,
- viewing the list of contact messages (emails and short text messages) drafted on the survey platform, including hints of translation progress.

## [Managing fieldwork](fieldwork.md)

- publishing surveys to samples. Publication is a prerogative of study coordinators users, even for national waves. Samples are the smallest units to which a survey can be published.
- triggering sending of email/text messages to a selection of samples. Recipients cand be limited based on survey completion status (e.g. reminders).
- following survey completion indicators during fieldwork.

## [Other operations](other-operations.md)

- importing additional sample variables in pre-defined slots (numeric and text values are provisioned).
- viewing and exporting a subset of panelist data fields (data fields viewable/exportable by study coordinators are part of the [sample CSV format specification](../nc/sample-import-export-fields.md))
