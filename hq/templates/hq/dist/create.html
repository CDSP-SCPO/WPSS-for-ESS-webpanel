            As a first step, the form below will allow you to select a
            survey and target panels, a give a short and meaningful
            description of the intended use of this link
            set. No links will be generated yet.

        <p>
            Generating the links will come as a separate step,
            at which point you will be asked to specify the
            link's expiry date. This can be done from the links set's detail page.
