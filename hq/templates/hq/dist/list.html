            The first step in the process of distributing a survey to
            panelits is to create a <b>set of individual links.</b> Given a
            selection of panels, each panelist will get a unique link
            that can be used to answer the survey.

            This link will be accessible in the panelist portal, but
            most importantly, when a set of individual links is
            generated, it can be communicated by email or SMS to its
            recipients.  This can be orchestrated from the <a href="{% url 'hq:msg-distribution-list' %}">Message
            deliveries</a> section.
        </p>
        <p>
            The list below summarizes the existing link sets. For more
            details, click on the link set's identifier in the first
            column called. Link sets that have no generation and
            expiration date are ready but not yet generated.
        </p>
        <p>
            The button below will take you to an interface through
            which you can create a new set of individual links. Note
            that several independent sets of links can be generated
            for the same survey through time. An example use case for
            this would be a recurring survey that needs to be
            delivered monthly to a panel.
